I'm a PhD student at the [Department of Mathematics and Applications][DMA] of [ENS Ulm][ENS] in Paris, working under the supervision of [Gabriel Peyré][gpeyre] and [François-Xavier Vialard][fxvialard]. This work is part of the [Noria][noria] ERC project.

## Research Interests

My research field is **Machine Learning** and I study the theoretical properties of neural networks, more particularly deep ResNets. I use tools from the theory of optimization, Optimal Control and Optimal Transport to study the convergence of gradient based algorithm in the training of neural networks.

In a broader picture, I'm interested in Machine Learning and Data Science as it offers a variety of mathematical problems, lying at the intersection between various fields of mathematics.
