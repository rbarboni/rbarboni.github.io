I'm a PhD student at the [Department of Mathematics and Applications][DMA] of [ENS Ulm][ENS] in Paris. I graduated this year from a M.Sc. in Machine Learning and Data Science (["Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage"][MVA]) at Université Paris-Saclay.

## Research Interests

I'm currently working under the supervision of [Gabriel Peyré][gpeyre] and [François-Xavier Vialard][fxvialard]. We study the mathematical properties of Deep Neural Networks and aim at explaining their good performances in supervised learning tasks. This work is part of the [Noria][noria] ERC project.

In a broader picture, I'm interested in Machine Learning and Data Science as it offers a variety of (often unsolved) mathematical problems, lying at the intersection between various fields of mathematics.
