### Education

I'm a student at the [Department of Mathematics and Applications][DMA] of [ENS Ulm][ENS] in Paris. I graduated this year from a Msc. in Machine Learning and Data Science (["Mathématiques, Vision, Apprentissage"][MVA]) at Paris-Saclay University.

You can take a look at my [CV](/CV_english_RBarboni.pdf "English CV") !

### Research Interests

I'm currently working under the supervision of [Gabriel Peyré][gpeyre] and [François-Xavier Vialard][fxvialard]. We study the mathematical properties of Deep Neural Networks and aim at explaining their good performances. This work is a part of the [Noria][noria] ERC project.

In a broader picture, I'm interested in Data Science as it offers a variety of (often yet unsolved) mathematical problems lying at the intersection between various fields of mathematics.
