I'm a student at the [Department of Mathematics and Applications][DMA] of [ENS Ulm][ENS] in Paris. I graduated this year from a Msc. in Machine Learning and Data Science (["Mathématique, Vision, Apprentissage"][MVA]) at Paris-Saclay University. 

###Research Interests
I'm currently working under the supervision of [Gabriel Peyré][gpeyre] and [François-Xavier Vialard][fxvialard] on the mathematical properties of Deep Neural Networks. This work is taking place in the [Noria][noria] ERC project.
