This page aims at sharing some of the projects I worked on during my studies.

### My Thesis project

- ["Convergence and Implicit biases of Deep Residual Networks" (french)](/Projet_these.pdf)
  
  This PhD Thesis will be supervised by G.Peyré and F-X.Vialard.

### Research internship report

- In 2022, I performed a research internship at ETH Zürich under supervision of [Pr. A. Bandeira](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~abandeira/). I studied statistical properties of random "Kikuchi" matrices (details to come).
* ["Convergence and Geometric properties of Gradient Descent in the training of Deep Residual Networks"](/Internship_Report.pdf)  
  This work was carried out as a part of my Master's research internship, under supervision of G.Peyré and F-X.Vialard. We studied mathematical properties of the optimization methods in the training of deep Neural Networks.

### Class projects

* ["Sliced Wasserstein Flows: Non-parametric generative modeling via optimal transport and diffusions"](/Report_OT.pdf)  
  This report is based on the work of [Liutkus et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08141).

* ["Wasserstein projection for texture synthesis"](/Rapport_Imagerie.pdf)  
  We work with T.Naït on an article from [Rabin et al.](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00476064/document).

### Bachelor Thesis

* "Mean curvature flow: An introduction to geometrical flows"  
  This is a small Bachelor thesis written under supervision of T.Ozuch. We studied the behavior of surfaces evolving under a velocity field that is locally defined by their mean curvature. We took interest in the so-called "level-set" method and studied the well-posedness of the associated PDE in the sense of viscosity solutions.
