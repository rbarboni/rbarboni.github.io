We published a new preprint on ["Ultra-fast feature learning for the training of two-layer neural networks in the two-timescale regime"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18208).

Considering a *Variable Projection* or *two-timescale learning* strategy, we show that during training, the distribution of inner weights of two-layer neural networks evolve according to an *ultra-fast diffusion equation*.
