I am thrilled to announce that I started a postdoc at the [Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics (BIDSA)](https://bidsa.unibocconi.eu/).

I will be mentored by [Giacomo Zanella](https://sites.google.com/site/gzanellawebpage/home) as part of the ERC project *"Provable Scalability for high-dimensional Bayesian Learning"*.
